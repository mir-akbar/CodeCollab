# Leave Session Fix - COMPLETED ✅

## Issue Summary
The leave session functionality was not working properly because participants with 'invited' status could not leave sessions. The `_leaveSessionNew` method was only looking for participants with 'active' status, but invited users have 'invited' status.

## Root Cause
In `/api/services/sessionService.js`, the `_leaveSessionNew` method was using this query:

```javascript
const participant = await SessionParticipant.findOne({
  sessionId,
  userEmail,
  status: 'active'  // ❌ Only looked for 'active' participants
});
```

However, invited users have `status: 'invited'`, so the method would return "User not found" even though the user existed in the session.

## Solution Applied
Updated the query to include both 'active' and 'invited' statuses:

```javascript
const participant = await SessionParticipant.findOne({
  sessionId,
  userEmail,
  status: { $in: ['active', 'invited'] }  // ✅ Now handles both statuses
});
```

## Testing Results
- **Before Fix**: Leave API returned success but session remained in user's session list
- **After Fix**: Leave API works correctly and session is removed from user's session list

### Test Verification:
1. Sessions before leave: 1
2. Leave API call: SUCCESS  
3. Sessions after leave: 0 ✅

## Files Modified
- `/Users/mirakbari/Downloads/CodeLab-main 4/api/services/sessionService.js` (Line ~404)

## Status: RESOLVED ✅
The leave session functionality now works correctly for both invited and active participants.
