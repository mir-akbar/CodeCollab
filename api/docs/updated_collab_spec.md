## Detailed Requirements

### 1. Authentication & User Management

#### AWS Cognito Integration
The platform utilizes AWS Cognito User Pool (ap-south-1_NmX1a5CZS) named "CodeCollab-Enhanced" for comprehensive user authentication and authorization. The Cognito configuration enforces robust password policies requiring minimum eight characters with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Email verification is automatically handled through Cognito's built-in verification system, with users able to sign in using either email addresses or preferred usernames.

#### Hybrid User Management Architecture
The system implements a hybrid approach combining Cognito authentication with a lightweight MongoDB User collection for performance optimization. Upon successful Cognito authentication, essential user information is extracted and stored in the local User collection, including the Cognito sub identifier, display name, email, profile picture URL, and activity timestamps. This design enables rapid access to user information during real-time collaboration while maintaining Cognito as the authoritative source for authentication and detailed profile management.

#### User Data Synchronization
The authentication flow populates the User collection immediately following successful Cognito authentication, extracting relevant attributes such as email, preferred username, given name, family name, and profile picture when available. A synchronization mechanism ensures consistency between the local User collection and Cognito user pool data, implemented through either Cognito triggers or periodic synchronization processes that update user information when profiles are modified.

### 2. Role-Based Access Control System

#### Owner Role (Highest Privilege)
The Owner role maintains comprehensive control over session management with authority to create and delete sessions, invite users via email or shareable links, remove any user from the session, and assign or modify roles for all participants. Owners possess unrestricted access to all session features and files while retaining the ability to transfer ownership to other users when necessary.

#### Admin Role (High Privilege)
Admin users possess elevated privileges including the ability to invite users to sessions, remove users with Editor or Viewer roles, and modify roles for Editor and Viewer users. However, Admin users cannot modify their own role to Owner status and cannot remove or modify other Admin or Owner users. They maintain full access to code editing and file management capabilities within their assigned sessions.

#### Editor Role (Medium Privilege)
Editor users can edit and modify files within sessions, upload new files, execute code and view outputs, and participate in chat and video calls. They cannot invite or remove users from sessions and lack authority to modify user roles within the collaborative environment.

#### Viewer Role (Lowest Privilege)
Viewer users access files and code in read-only mode, view code execution outputs, and participate in chat and video calls. They cannot edit files, upload new content, invite users, or modify roles within the session.

### 3. Session Management & Database Architecture

#### MongoDB Database Design
The system utilizes MongoDB as the primary data store for session management, file storage, and collaboration features. The database schema consists of five core collections designed to support the collaborative editing requirements and role-based access control system.

The Sessions collection serves as the central entity containing session metadata, participant information with assigned roles, and configuration settings. Each session document includes the session owner's Cognito sub identifier, unique session identifier for sharing, creation timestamp, session name and description, and a participants array containing user references with their respective roles and permissions. Session documents also maintain activity tracking information and configuration settings for collaboration features.

The User collection implements the hybrid user management approach, storing essential user information extracted from Cognito for performance optimization during real-time collaboration. This collection contains the Cognito sub as the primary identifier, display name and username for interface presentation, email address and profile picture URL, activity timestamps, and presence status information. The collection is populated automatically upon successful Cognito authentication and maintained through synchronization processes.

The UserSessions collection creates the many-to-many relationship between users and sessions, enabling efficient dashboard queries and session access management. Each document contains the user's Cognito sub identifier, session reference, assigned role within the specific session, join date and activity timestamps, and user preferences such as favorite session flags for dashboard organization.

The Files collection maintains the hierarchical file structure necessary for the tree-view interface and collaborative editing functionality. File documents include session references, complete file paths supporting folder organization, file content and metadata including type and size information, version control data for change tracking, and access permissions derived from the session's role-based structure.

The ChatMessages collection stores real-time communication data with session references, sender information from the User collection, message content and timestamps, and threading capabilities for organized conversation flow within collaborative sessions.

#### Session Creation and Management
Session creation generates unique identifiers and initializes session documents with comprehensive metadata including the creator designated as Owner role. The system supports named sessions with descriptive information, participant management capabilities, and configuration options for collaboration features. Session owners maintain full control over participant management, role assignments, and session configuration while the system enforces role-based permissions for all operations.

#### User Invitation and Access Control
The platform implements dual invitation mechanisms supporting both email-based invitations with role assignments and shareable session links with embedded role information. Email invitations generate temporary tokens mapping to specific sessions and predetermined roles, allowing invited users to accept invitations and join sessions with appropriate permissions. Shareable links encode session information and default roles, providing immediate access while maintaining security through proper validation and authentication requirements.

#### Session Dashboard Architecture
The session dashboard provides users with organized access to their collaborative sessions through three distinct categories. The interface displays sessions created by the user where they maintain Owner privileges, sessions where they have been invited as participants with various role assignments, and favorited sessions marked for quick access and frequent use. Each session listing includes participant counts, recent activity indicators, and role-based access information to help users quickly identify their permissions and responsibilities within each collaborative environment.

The dashboard implements efficient querying mechanisms that retrieve session information through aggregated MongoDB queries, ensuring optimal performance even with large numbers of sessions and participants. Recent activity tracking provides timestamps and activity summaries that help users prioritize their collaboration efforts and maintain awareness of ongoing project developments.
